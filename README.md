# Azem OS

A personalize image based off of [Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg/) for gaming and software development. To share settings across systems, I recommend setting up a [dotfiles repo](https://sarab.dev/posts/dotfiles-bare-git-repo/).

## Additional Features
The following are installed in addition to what is included in Bazzite.

### Programs
- 1Password
- Mullvad VPN 
- VSCodium 
- pipx
- podlet
- podman-compose

### Flatpaks
- Calibre
- Discord
- Syncthing (using Syncthingy)
- Obsidian.md
- LibreOffice
- Zoom
- Podman Desktop

### `ujust` commands

## Using Azem OS

First, install Bazzite using the [image picker](https://bazzite.gg/#image-picker) to get the desired image. Choose `Desktop`, `AMD` GPU, `KDE` desktop environment, `No` Steam gaming mode.

After installation, run the following command to switch to the AzemOS image
```bash
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/jordan-thirus/azemos:latest
```
This will queue for the next reboot, which you can do immediately after the command finishes. Future updates can be installed with the `ujust update` command.
